# AUMI Runbooks – Executive Summary

This document provides a high-level overview of the incident response runbooks included in the AUMI Human-Centred AI Responsibility Framework.

These runbooks define standardised procedures for managing critical operational, safety, and governance risks in production AI systems.

They are designed for enterprise, regulatory, and large-scale deployment environments.

---

## Scope

The runbooks cover incidents related to:

- AI model performance and degradation
- System latency and availability
- Data pipeline reliability
- Hallucination and factuality risks
- User-facing safety and experience failures

All runbooks follow a common governance structure aligned with risk management and human oversight principles.

---

## Included Runbooks

### 1. RB-ML-001 - Model Degradation / Accuracy Drop

Addresses incidents involving performance decline, drift, and output instability in deployed AI models.

Primary focus: Model reliability and quality governance.

---

### 2. RB-API-002 - API Latency / Timeout

Covers response delays, provider outages, and infrastructure-related availability risks.

Primary focus: Operational resilience.

---

### 3. RB-DATA-003 - Data Pipeline Failure

Manages failures in ingestion, preprocessing, embedding, and vector synchronisation pipelines.

Primary focus: Data integrity and freshness.

---

### 4. RB-HALL-004 - Hallucination Spike

Handles increases in incorrect, fabricated, or unsafe AI outputs.

Primary focus: Safety and trust protection.

---

### 5. RB-USER-005 - User-Impacting Incident

Addresses harmful, offensive, or workflow-breaking user-facing incidents.

Primary focus: User experience and responsibility.

---

## Governance Principles

All runbooks are governed by:

- Risk-based escalation models
- Human-in-the-loop oversight
- Continuous evaluation systems
- Incident documentation standards
- Post-incident improvement cycles

Operational thresholds and internal benchmarks are maintained separately.

---

## Supplementary Materials

Extended case studies, evaluation frameworks, and review documents may be maintained externally for reference purposes.

Links are provided within individual runbook READMEs where applicable.
